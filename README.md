# Lang2SQL
last updated 4/18/2024

Creating an English to SQL query generator using OpenAI API. User needs to give the table names and a specific query request, as well as load in the data, Lang2SQL will return the corresponding SQL query.

How to run this?  
a) It's recommended to set up a virtual enviornment in Python and have all required packages installed there. For how to set it up, refer to [Virtual Environment Setup.txt](Virtual Environment Setup.txt)
